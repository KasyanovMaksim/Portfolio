      <h3>MY BACKGROUND</h3>
      <p>
        My fascination with building began as Front-end developer, gradually evolving into complex Angular architectures and full-scale Design systems. I started as a layout developer and freelancer — but over time, I became deeply inspired by the harmony between Product design and front-end Engineering.
        This dual perspective gave me an edge: I began to see systems not just as code or visuals, but as living interfaces shaped by logic, clarity and user roles. Could I build not just screens — but meaningful, scalable experiences?
        Today, I combine product thinking with Angular expertise, crafting modular libraries, and UI tokens for visual systems that empower teams and ensure consistency across brands. I specialize in organizing complex interfaces  — with role-based flows, minimal prototyping, and full accessibility in mind.
